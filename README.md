# Movie Data Scraping and Visualization - Flatiron Data Science
## Introduction
This data science exercise demonstrated the use of data collection and data analysis to draw business-domain conclusions in the example field of movie production. The **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** Python libraries were used for webscraping, and the **Pandas** and **Seaborn** libraries were used for analysis and visualizations.

## About the Dataset
Our dataset is comprised of details on 6,759 movies. Basic movie information was populated through API calls generously provided by The Movie Database. Financial box office numbers were scraped from BoxOfficeMojo, and critical and popular reception was scraped from IMDb.

## Results
We created a presentation with insights and recommended action based on our analysis. We created
