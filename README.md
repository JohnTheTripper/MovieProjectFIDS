# Movie Data Scraping and Visualization - Flatiron Data Science
## Introduction
This data science exercise demonstrated the use of data collection and data analysis to draw business-domain conclusions in the example field of movie production. The **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** Python libraries were used for webscraping, and the **Pandas** and **Seaborn** libraries were used for analysis and visualizations.
